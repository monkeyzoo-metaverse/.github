MonkeyZoo
The MonkeyZoo project is creating NFT fusion technology that will enable digital assets to be easily composable and power a decentralized future for gaming. Each of the MonkeyZoo character can be manipulated using our technology in the FusionZoo to create a personal avatar to suit your personality.

This Github Repository contains some technologies we have implemented on the [Chia Blockchain](https://www.chia.net).

More info on what we are up to can be found at [monkeyzoo.net](https://monkeyzoo.net)
